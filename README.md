# MarketingRuCode

## Problem Description
RuCodeBank(fictitious), like any other bank, sometimes conducts marketing campaigns over the phone, offering customers new services.
However, the working hours of managers who call customers are expensive, and the percentage of people who eventually agree to buy the service is quite low.
To optimize the advertising campaign process, you were asked to create a machine learning model that would predict whether the bank's customer would be interested in the service offered.
There is a training sample train.csv with information about the bank's customers who were offered the service of opening a deposit at RuCodeBank by phone. 
The target variable 'contact_office' shows whether the customer has agreed to the offered service or not. 
You need to use machine learning for all the people in the test.csv sample to predict whether the customer will buy the service or not.
The quality of predictions is evaluated by the metric F1score: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score.

## Results
Despite the fact that the final result was less than 70 percent, it was one of the best results that could be obtained on this dataset during testing.
Unfortunately I couldn't find the time to participate in the final https://digital.tatarstan.ru/index.htm/news/1836680.htm
